# CloudWatch Metric Usage Lambda

There are several benefits of configuring [Amazon CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html) for managing Cloudwatch observability across a large number of accounts within your organization, allowing you to create consoldiated dashboards to view metrics across your organization, reduce duplicated monitoring infrastructure, easier reporting.

It does however present a challenge in managing observability costs and cost attribution. When serveral accounts are sending their metrics to a common account, it makes it difficult in trying to identify and map the amount of metrics generated by individual accounts in the monitoring account, since account IDs are not automatically included in metric dimentions by default.  

This project looks at a way to identify and track unique metrics generated by individual accounts that are sent to the monitoring account. Thereby providing a tool for administrators to identify specific accounts and investigate and rectify any misconfigurations or bad actors.

 The lambda function lists all metrics across all accounts sent to the monitoring account, aggreates it by account id and publishes one metric as a TotalMetricCount that gives a view of metric count per account.


## Overview

This project uses AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to deploy a Lambda function that:

1. Runs on a scheduled basis (every 5 minutes by default)
2. Lists all CloudWatch metrics across linked accounts
3. Aggregates metric usage data by account
4. Publishes a new CloudWatch metric showing the total metric count for each account

This solution is particularly useful for monitoring organizations with multiple AWS accounts that send metrics to a central monitoring account, helping to track CloudWatch usage and potential costs.

## Sample Dashboard

The solution consists of:

- A Lambda function that executes on a schedule
- IAM permissions to list metrics and publish new metrics
- CloudWatch Events rule for scheduled execution
- A terraform template that can generate a simple monitoring dashboard

## Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) installed
- Python 3.13 or later
- Appropriate AWS permissions to deploy the SAM template

```

## Installation and Deployment

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cloudwatch-metric-usage-lambda/sam_helper/cw-metric-usage-monitor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r code/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```

### Deployment

1. Build the SAM application:
   ```
   sam build
   ```

2. Deploy the application:
   ```
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

   Follow the prompts to configure your deployment settings.

3. For subsequent deployments:
   ```
   sam deploy
   ```

## Configuration

The Lambda function can be configured through the following:

- **Schedule**: By default, the function runs every 5 minutes. You can modify this in the `template.yaml` file.
- **Region**: The function is set to monitor metrics in `us-east-1`. You can change this in `app.py`.
- **Namespace and Metric Name**: The aggregated metrics are published to the `testnamespace` namespace with the name `testmetric`. Customize these values in `app.py`.

## How It Works

1. The Lambda function is triggered by a CloudWatch Events rule on a schedule.
2. It uses the CloudWatch API to list all metrics across linked accounts.
3. It aggregates the metrics by account ID and calculates total usage.
4. It publishes a new metric to CloudWatch with the total count for each account.
5. The metrics can be viewed in the CloudWatch console or used for alerting.

## IAM Permissions

The Lambda function requires the following permissions:

- `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`: To retrieve metrics data
- `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`: To publish aggregated metrics

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- View the Lambda function logs in CloudWatch Logs
- Monitor the published metrics in CloudWatch Metrics under the `testnamespace` namespace
- Check the Lambda function execution history in the AWS Lambda console
