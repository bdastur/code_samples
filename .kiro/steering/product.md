# Product Overview

This repository contains cloud solutions and code samples focused on AWS services integration and observability. The primary solution demonstrates streaming CloudWatch metrics to OpenTelemetry collectors using AWS Lambda and Kinesis Firehose.

## Key Solutions

- **CloudWatch Streams Transform Lambda**: A proof-of-concept that transforms CloudWatch metrics from Kinesis Firehose format to OpenTelemetry format and forwards them to OTEL collectors
- **MCP Examples**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations for demonstration purposes

## Target Use Cases

- Real-time metrics streaming and transformation
- CloudWatch to OpenTelemetry integration
- AWS serverless observability patterns
- MCP server development examples

## Important Notes

- All code samples are provided for demonstration and learning purposes
- Solutions require proper review, testing, and security hardening before production use
- Each solution includes detailed setup instructions and architecture documentation
