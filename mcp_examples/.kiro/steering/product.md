# Product Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) demonstration project that showcases client-server communication for AI tool integration. The project implements a calculator service that can be accessed by AI models through the MCP protocol.

## Key Features

- **MCP Calculator Server**: Provides mathematical operations (add, subtract) as tools that can be called by AI models
- **MCP Client**: Demonstrates how to connect to MCP servers and integrate with AWS Bedrock for AI model interactions
- **Dual Transport Support**: Supports both stdio and HTTP streamable transports for flexibility
- **AWS Integration**: Uses AWS Bedrock with Claude models for natural language processing

## Use Cases

- Educational demonstration of MCP protocol implementation
- Template for building custom MCP tools and servers
- Integration pattern for AI models with external calculation services
